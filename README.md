# stlog

## What is it?

**ST**andard **ST**ructured **LOG** Python 3.7+ logging library built on [standard python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) and [contextvars](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextvars.html).

The library is **dependency free** but:

- borrows plenty of ideas and code from [daiquiri](https://github.com/Mergifyio/daiquiri) library (thanks to [Mergify](https://mergify.com/) and [Julien DANDJOU](https://julien.danjou.info/).
- borrows some code from [python-json-logger](https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger) (thanks to [Zakaria ZAJAC](https://github.com/madzak))
- can use fancy stuff (colors, augmented traceback...) from the [rich library](https://github.com/Textualize/rich) if installed
